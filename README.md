## Setup
Follow these steps to set up the bot:

1. Fill in the configuration details in `config/config.ts`.
2. Run the following command in your console to install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. If you're using TypeScript, run the following command to transpile the code:
    ```
    npx tsc
    ```
   If you're using JavaScript, you can skip this step.

4. Start the bot:

     ts-node dist/index.ts
     ```

Feel free to customize the configuration and modify the code as per your requirements.

## Usage
Once the bot is set up and running, it will handle DM welcomer, welcomer, greeter, message leaderboard, ticket system, report user system, and other functionalities as configured in the code. ðŸŽ‰
